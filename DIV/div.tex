The Machine Learning research community suffers from an under
representation of women, people of color, and other minorities. If we
believe that the future of technology hinges on {\em Artificial
  Intelligence (AI)}, we should get everyone involved in the
development of the foundations of AI, so that the future technology
enganges with the needs and interests of a wider population. If I am
given the opportunity to advise graduate students at your esteemed
university, I will make it my priority to assemble a research group
that includes women, people of color, and other minorities. I will
actively encourage and empower my undergraduate students of all
backgrounds to pursue a carrier in research in AI.

I have long been committed to promoting a culture of inclusion and
diversity. During graduate school, one of my colleagues underwent male
to female transition, and I tried my best to support them during the
difficult process. In my current role as a Research Scientist at
Google Brain, I have mentored $3$ women (``Sara Sabour'', ``Yijie
Guo'', and ``Azalia Mirhosseini'') who led $3$ of my recent projects
resulting in two papers at ICLR $2019$ and one at ICML $2017$. I have
collaborated with different researchers with different ethnicities,
sexual orientations, and religous beliefs, and I have learned that


individuals with diverse backgrounds often bring complementary ideas
and insights. 

I have been involved in recruiting for the Google Brain
Toronto team, and I am proud to share that out of a group of $9$ full
time researchers we have $3$ women. Another example of my commitment
to diversity was when
